# replace-a-branch

How to replace a Git branch.

I'm trying to demo two things:

* using Jupyter Notebook for bash 
* running a bash notebook inside of GitPod.

I'm just trying to figure these out,
so you can consider this ***under heavy development***.

Right now, I can get the current version of the notebook to run fine on my laptop, in a virtual environment (`python -mvenv .venv`), if I install the bash kernel (`pip install bash_kernel`)
before I launch Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`).

Getting this working in GitPod, however, is still a bridge too far.
